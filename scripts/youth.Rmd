q38 has option 99 as "I don't know" and there is no "no response" option. Probably an error because other items in scale (q36 - q 40) have 88 = "I don't know" and 99 = "refuse to answer". 

Because code below changes the values of the data, I am leaving this item with the coding as is: 99 as "I don't know". It will anyways be converted as NA for scales.

#          q38 = ifelse(q38 == 99, 88, q68))  # for some reason this completely changes the values of the data.
